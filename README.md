# Spotify Hotkeys

> ### A program to add configurable Global Hotkeys to Spotify. Using my [Spotify API Boilerplate](https://github.com/andrewgosselin/Spotify-Authorization-Boilerplate) this app has you sign in and uses that information to create hotkeys in your system for a lot of different operations in spotify.

This repo is under heavy development.

**Note:** More documentation will be added as this project progresses.
